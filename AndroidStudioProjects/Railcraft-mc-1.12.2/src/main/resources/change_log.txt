	NEW: Steam Locomotives can now pull fuel and water from attached carts.
	NEW: Rewrote the entire system for moving items and fluids around within Trains. It should be more compatible and less buggy than the previous system.
	INFO: The way the system works is that push and pull requests can only pass through carts that allow them to be passed. For example Chest Carts can pass item requests, but not fluid request. And Tank Carts can pass fluid requests but not item requests.
	INFO: Because of the way the system works, you can either attach a Chest Cart to your Steam Locomotive to supply fuel or a Tank Cart to supply water, but not both. Choices are good.

	NEW: Add Signalling Goggle Aura, a combination of the Tuning and Surveying Aura.
	FIX: Rock Crusher can now crush Entities again.

	FIX: Detector and Directional Detector Track should wait a few ticks before turning off the redstone. Helps prevents pulsing while trains pass over, which often led to glitchy railway logic.
	FIX: Make Receiver Boxes occasionally update their neighbors to prevent situations where the Receiver says one thing and attached blocks another. Could happen when the Receiver was in a different chunk from the adjacent block.
	FIX: Have Block Signals save the last known position of track end positions to NBT. Should prevent Signals from returning Yellow if the chunk on the opposite end isn't loaded. May cause traffic jams and collision if your trains don't have Anchor Carts.
	FIX: Increase the area that Anchor Carts keep chunkloaded from 3x3 chunks to 5x5 chunks in order to help reduce chunkloading derived issues for moving Trains.
	FIX: Boilers and Hobbyist Engines should defer water triggered explosions until their own update tick. Should prevent other mods from crashing when their block randomly disappears mid-update.
	FIX: Disabling any blocks or items used in Rock Crusher recipes should no longer crash. Issue #602
	FIX: Prevent Locking Tracks from reseting in the middle of a Train by searching for nearby carts that are 'almost' on the track.
	FIX: Fix various issues with Signal and Controller/Receiver pairing that could result in dropped links and other random bugs.

	FIX: Locomotives now properly idle when any cart in the train is held in place by a track.
	FIX: Creosote Cells are actually registered now.

6.14.0.26:

6.14.0.21:
	CHANGE: High Speed Explosions are now more impressive and spread flames. I can do this because I'm fairly confident that I finally fixed all of the bugs with HS Track.
	FIX: Completely scrapped the unreliable methods of detecting sudden stops at High Speed in favor of marking tracks as "safe" or "not safe". 
		Safe tracks are HS straight tracks that are connected to other HS Tracks on both ends. This can include unswitched Turnout Switches, but Wye Switches are never "safe".
		Carts will explode if they are moving at HS and encounter a "not safe" track.
	FIX: Fixed a bug in the collision code that could result in random HS Explosions of Trains immediately following a chunk load.
	FIX: Link drag is only applied if the Locomotive Module is active.

	CHANGE: Changed Infernal Brick recipe to be similar to Sandy Brick. Reduces the Soul Sand cost by a 1/5th.

6.14.0.0:
	NEW: Added a means to make Steel if the Blast Furnace is disabled. You need to break an Iron Ingot into Iron Nuggets and cook those in a Furnace to get Steel Nuggets.
	NEW: Added Villager Detector.  *Railcraft Inc. does not condone the enslavement of Villagers for breeding and/or other nefarious purposes.
	NOTE: The Villager Detector currently only works with vanilla Villagers, mod added villagers will be supported in a later update.

	FIX: Fixed a bug in the Pairing network code that broke the Tuning Aura for addons.

6.13.1.2:
	SNEAK-PEAK: Locomotives, texture is a work in progress (open to suggestions), two-tone rendering isn't in yet, gui is still missing the start/stop/idle buttons, no way to really control the locomotive's initial direction yet, but the basics work.
	NEW: Explicitly defined BC Facades for Infernal Brick, Sandy Brick, Steel Blocks, and Concrete Blocks.
	CHANGE: Tweaked Sandy Brick to Coke Oven Brick recipe, it should now have the same cost as directly crafting Coke Oven Brick.

6.13.1.1:
	NEW: Added Engineer's Overalls. Texture provided courtesy of the user, 'Foreplaying'.
	NEW: Added Trackman's Backpack, for holding all your Track/Minecart related stuff. Only available if Forestry is installed. Big thanks to Sengir for the API. (there are some issues with the display name still)

	NEW: Added config to print Anchor locations to the log on world load.
	NEW: Applying a redstone signal to World Anchors will now shut them off. Just don't expect to be able to turn them back on again without being nearby. No fuel is used while off.

	NEW: Added Sandy Brick.
	CHANGE: Updated loot chest code, added Armor as loot, redistributed loot more logically (minecart stuff in mineshafts, tools at a blacksmith, armor in temples, etc...).
	FIX: Train Dispensers now work better with Anchor Carts.
	API: Reworked the Controller/Receiver API a bit to make it easier for addons to do many-to-many pairing (there were some minor issues still). Will break anything that includes the Signal Package again. =/

6.12.2.1:
	INFO: Updated Forestry API.
	CHANGE: Rewrote the Recipe config section of the config file to use subcats and be more consistent. If you used non-default recipe settings, you will need to change them again.

	CHANGE: Doubled Turbine input/output values. You now need 8 gold pipes to max a single Turbine. I suggest just building them next to a Boiler though.
	FIX: Rewrote the Multi-Block packet to send fewer bytes per packet.

6.10.0.5:
	FIX: UE integration may be fixed (untested).
	FIX: World Anchors should now properly request new tickets after the ticket has been released.

	FIX: Updated some of the newer MC blocks on the Bore whitelist.

6.10.0.2:
	INFO: This is an extremely experimental release, many things changed under the hood with both Signals and Anchors. I can't promise it won't break existing setups (if it does its a bug that must be fixed before release).
	INFO: More changes are planned to Signal Block pairing and I will be adding a new aura that will let you see how controller/receiver pairing are setup.
	NEW: World Anchors and Anchor Carts now require Ender Pearls to fuel their operation (configurable). One Ender Pearl will by default last for 6 hours. Anchor Carts retain their fuel values when broken.
	CHANGE: Doubled base Boiler fuel usage (3.2 -> 6.4), increased efficiency bonus per tank to 0.08, doubled liquid fuel values. Basically a nerf to solid fuel. (experimental)

	CHANGE: Feed Station gets a new recipe: 4 Chests + 4 Planks + 1 Enchanted Golden Apple = 4 Feed Stations
